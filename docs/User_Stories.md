Radio waves widely exist around us, although we cannot see them. There are various kinds
of systems using wireless connections. We focus on identifying "rogue" devices such as unauthorized 
cell phones, computers, sensors, smart home devices trying to either exfilterate or intefere with other
authorized devices. This is actually also the main direction and focus, my team would be working on.


1. #### Corporate Office
    In Corporate office, the board room is most valuable asset for attacker/competitor to learn about 
    customers, partners, strategy, financial results, and intellectual property. In other way we can 
    say, C-suite or R&DE publishes very sensitive information in both verbal and written format. 
    Whether you are a startup or Fortune 100 company, keeping the executive room protected is a top priority.
    Potential bug can be 'IMSI Catcher' to track all persons present or presence of any nefarious device 
    to listen or record.


2. #### Policy Violation
    "It’s one thing to have a “no cell phones in this area” policy. It’s another thing to detect policy violations!"

    Many firms face range of issues when employee use there personal device instead of company-issued 
    devices, and even if they mandate to carry out all commuication using company-issued devices 
    their employeers have no legitimate way to record or track these communications. In the event of regulatory enquiries
    it often require proof that compliance submit electronic communications but without any system to prove there were
    no additional devices involved it can take regulatory longer to resolve.
